General:
########################
- JavaDocs: These are completely missing
- add support for primitive types (float, int ...)? How about lists, iterators then? 
- add helper class for XsdDuration (namely for creating a XsdDuration instance)
- XsdTypes: Entity currently ignored
- Output path: Either absolute or otherwise relative to project root!


Generate Jena Code:
########################
- How about OCL as query language?
- Use Sparql for Count?

Generated Code:
Use maxCardinality, transitive, inverse functional etc. property characteristics
